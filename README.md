## AWS IoT SDK for Java v2

Next generation AWS IoT Client SDK for Java using the AWS Common Runtime

This project is in **DEVELOPER PREVIEW** while we gather feedback on
interfaces and use cases. Please file issues and feature requests.
Expect breaking API changes as we incorporate feedback.
Until this project is promoted to General Availability, we advise you use the
[previous SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-java)
for a stable development environment.

This SDK is built on the AWS Common Runtime, a collection of libraries
([aws-c-common](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-common),
[aws-c-io](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-io),
[aws-c-mqtt](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-mqtt), ...) written in C to be
cross-platform, high-performance, secure, and reliable. The libraries are bound
to Java by the [aws-crt-java](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-crt-java) package.

Integration with AWS IoT Services such as
[Device Shadow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html)
and [Jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-jobs.html)
is provided by code that been generated from a model of the service.

# Samples

## Shadow

This sample uses the AWS IoT
[Device Shadow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html)
Service to keep a property in
sync between device and server. Imagine a light whose color may be changed
through an app, or set by a local user.

Once connected, type a value in the terminal and press Enter to update
the property's "reported" value. The sample also responds when the "desired"
value changes on the server. To observe this, edit the Shadow document in
the AWS Console and set a new "desired" value.

On startup, the sample requests the shadow document to learn the property's
initial state. The sample also subscribes to "delta" events from the server,
which are sent when a property's "desired" value differs from its "reported"
value. When the sample learns of a new desired value, that value is changed
on the device and an update is sent to the server with the new "reported"
value.

## Jobs

This sample uses the AWS IoT
[Jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-jobs.html)
Service to describe jobs to execute.

This sample requires you to create jobs for your device to execute. See
[instructions here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/create-manage-jobs.html).

On startup, the sample describes a job that is pending execution.
